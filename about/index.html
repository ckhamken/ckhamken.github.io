      <h1>Hi, I'm Chris!</h1>
      <h3>I'm a mechanical design engineer based out of Atlanta.</h3>

      <p>Unequal parts dog dad, engineer, designer, photographer, traveler, and water lover [ironically] based out of the Atlanta area where you can often find him indulging in the vast assortment of ethnic cuisine.</p>

      <p>Professionally, he is currently employed as a mechanical engineer responsible for the design, development, and execution of highly efficient automated assembly and test machines utilized in automotive and medical applications spanning the globe. He continues to build upon years of practical knowledge and experience after honing his hands-on fabrication skills early on at a nationally recognized military subcontractor privately owned and operated by family.</p>

      <p>When not professionally designing industrial machines, Chris occassionally spends time offering freelance product and tooling design services with utilizing professional CAD software and rapid-prototyping resources.</p>
      
      <p><a href="../photos/">Photography</a> is a hobby that Chris is slowly starting to rediscover the passion for after a few years hiatus. However, the convenience of highly capable cameras on our phones do not help.</p>

      <p>Chris is also passionate about sharing his <a href="../travel/">travels</a> — mostly for himself through meticulously crafted photosets. They're a great way to relive past experiences and share them with friends. As with everything else, Chris is always thinking of ways to improve, rethink and redesign them for future travels.</p>

      <!--<p style="font-size:smaller;">NOTE: I originally started this website in 2012 as a way to share my portfolio of professional &amp; personal projects. Over time I became inspired to add more components so I added a photography section while other ideas never made it to light due to various life obligations and pure laziness. After realizing how outdated it had become, I committed to completely revamping it to what you see today. Everything you see on this site was designed and developed myself. Pages are generated using the static site generator Jekyll and hosted on Amazon S3 with CloudFront; a long way from the G4 Mac Mini I used to host this site with.</p>-->
